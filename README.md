# React-n-Whack-Game

This project was completed as part of the _Embedded System Design_ course during my fourth year of university and had for goal to provide students the opportunity to apply theory acquired from lecture time. This build was a mix of circuit building and Arduino code to simulate two mini-games: a reaction timer and whack-a-mole.
